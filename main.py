    TODO (8 Steps):
    1) Read & Understand: what is "fewest handoffs" here?
    2) Re-phrase: say the goal in simple words.
    3) Identify I/O: inputs graph, s, t; output list or None.
    4) Break down: queue, visited, parent; loop until found.
    5) Pseudocode: write steps as comments above your code.
    6) Write code with deque.
    7) Debug with prints (locally).
    8) Optimize: state O(V+E) in README.
